## About 
RnD of MiBandApp, Unofficial Client for Mi Band . - I found [old WP8 version of MiBandApp](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?showtopic=792038), decompiled it via DotPeek, then "manuallty reversed" all vies/pages and resources. An,my plan are to dev more powerful Mi band app (real UWP app!) for old sweet retro-winphones Lumia ... :)

## Tech details
- I already fixed main app parts (except some usercontrols, main app views & viewmodels)
- At now, I'm doing research of Ian's Cariburn Micro "high-level coding" to fix all MiBandApp MVVM logics ;) 

## Planned features (to reconstruct)
- Counting steps and setting goals
- Smart alarm clocks
- Sleep tracking (PRO function)
- Step History (PRO function)
- Display of distance traveled and calories burned (PRO function)
- Full customization of the wristband
- Pulse measurement
- Syncing your history with OneDrive
- Mi Band Firmware Update
- Running detection
- Deep/Light sleep Recognition
 
## ToDo
- Try to fix +-100500 bugs after MiBand R.E.
- Repair all localization data (language resources for EN/RU at minimum)
- Try to add Mi Band 3,4, and 5 compatibility.
